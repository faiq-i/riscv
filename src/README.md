#Source Code

This directory the source code for the hardware implementation of the RISC-V processor in SystemVerilog. The simulations are not included for purposes of cleaner file management. The codes are very self explanatory.

The codes are fully tested on simulations with QuestaSim and Xilinx Vivado as well as on the Artix-A7 FPGA Development board with a clock frequency of around 1MHz. The results are as expected, however there is a need for optimizing the hardware so that it can run on higher clock frequencies.
